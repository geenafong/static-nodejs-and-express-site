            | As a junior software developer, I am fascinated by the various ways in which a career in software development can grow. I am currently working towards Treehouse’s Techdegree and have been thoroughly enjoying the various projects and everything that I have learned. I am personally interested in a career that uses technology to help with an individual’s everyday life. I would enjoy working with consumers to see ways in which a product can be tailored to address their specific needs.
